I was a student two years ago, at MSU Denver in the Industrial Design Program. I loved to design and build things, and being creative is what I enjoy. I love to complete problems that need some kind of creative process, and that's why I chose the Industrial Design route. I was enjoying the courses and more importanyly, the 3-D Design portion of designing. I couldn't stop thinking about,  " is this the right fit for me?" I spent my last semester struggling with continuing the program. So, I sat out the next semester to reflect and do more research. That is when I found Flatirons School, and started to research more about coding, what the school provides..and come to find out, I love it! It has many different problems the coder and the code provide, which I love. But more importantly, I still get to design! And thats where I really started to fall in love with coding. Through more research to see what school, what type of code I wanted to learn, and where I wanted to be in the future. I couldnt be more happy with my results and what I'm continuing to learn. I strive to be able to retain and explain the information I've learned so far, and will continue to learn as I progress through the program!
